# Pokedex

This is a little side project for my son. For now, I am just loading Pokemons (from the PokeApi: https://pokeapi.co) with an unlimited scroll with the use of ```IntersectionObserver``` at a later stage he will be able to select/search an individual Pokemon to see its full stats and evolution(s)
